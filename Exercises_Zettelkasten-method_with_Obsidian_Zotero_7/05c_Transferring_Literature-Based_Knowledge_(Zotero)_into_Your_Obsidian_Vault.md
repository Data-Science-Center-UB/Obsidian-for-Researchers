**Learning Objectives in this Exercise:**
- Transfer knowledge from Zotero to Obsidian.
- Process this knowledge using the **Zettelkasten method** in your Obsidian vault.
- This task requires that you have a basic understanding of how Zotero works.

## Step 1: Prepare the Article in Zotero

Before creating your third *Zettel*, open **Zotero**.

1. **Add the article** from Exercise 03a as a PDF to your Zotero library.  
   **DOI:** [Feline gravity manipulation](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2012.6248092)

2. **Highlight the following paragraph:**

   > *"To this end, we propose a theoretical model, which we tentatively call Modified Feline Gravitational Dynamics or MOFEGD."*

3. **Add this comment to the highlighted paragraph:**

   > MOFEGDE as a method should be used across the board; it is considered one of the author's most important discoveries.

4. **Add a the tag `#p1_literature_review` to the comment.**

5. **Clean up the reference item:**
   - Remove all existing tags from the reference item (not the PDF).
   - Add the tag: `skimmed`

## Step 2: Create a Source Note in Obsidian

1. **Open Obsidian.**
2. **Press** `Ctrl + P`, then select:  
   ➔ *Zotero Integration: Add Source Note*
3. The *Quick Format Citation* window will open (via Zotero).
4. **Search for and select the reference:** *Toth, 2025*
5. **Press** `Enter`.

## Step 3: Turn the Knowledge into a "Zettel"

*Each paragraph and its comment can now become an individual "Zettel". If you have many paragraphs, start with the most important ones. You can return later to process the rest.*

1. **Under the section containing the abstract, write the following link:**
	`[[error_pets_wearing_clothes]]`

**Click the link and create a new note** → **Press** ALT + E → **Select** "Zettel_Template"

2. **Click the link** to create a new note.

3. **Press** `Alt + E`, then **select** *Zettel_Template* to structure your note.

4. **Organize the content in the "Zettel"** as shown below.  
	*(You don’t need to fill in the reference section — backlinks will cover this.)*

## Step 4: Create a Subject Index

Since you now have three "Zettel" related to the topic of cats — and you plan to continue working on this subject — this is a great moment to create a dedicated tag page.

1. **In your Obsidian vault**, navigate to your Zettelkasten folder (e.g., `ZEKA/ZETTEL`).

2. **Create a new note titled:** `[[cats]]`

3. **Click the link** to generate the new page.

4. **Inside the new "cats" page**, add a link to one of your cat-related Zettels.  
	For example: `[[cats_in_space]]`

*This link will serve as an **entry point** to all your notes about cats, helping you build a connected knowledge base around this theme.*
