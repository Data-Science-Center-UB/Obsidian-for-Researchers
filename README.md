# Obsidian-for-Researchers

## 🧭 Overview
This repository provides two core learning resources designed to help you use Obsidian for scientific research — whether you're just getting started or looking to enhance an existing workflow:

**1. Learn the Basics of Obsidian** <br>
A step-by-step guide that introduces the fundamental features of Obsidian.
You’ll learn how to:
- Set up your personal Vault
- Use templates to streamline your daily workflow
- Organize and track tasks efficiently

**2. Apply the Zettelkasten Method with Obsidian and Zotero 7** <br>
A complete setup inspired by Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten method, including:
- Connecting Obsidian with Zotero 7
- Transferring literature-based knowledge into your Vault
- Building a personal system for long-term academic thinking and writing

❗️The second exercise builds on the settings of the first. Starting exclusively with the second exercise is at your own risk.

**Each resource is available in two formats:**

- Step-by-step instructions – ideal for beginners who want to build understanding while creating their Vault
- A finished example Vault – recommended for advanced users who want to dive in and explore the setup right away (see section 'Quick Start')

Choose the path that fits your needs.
