# Obsidian-for-Researchers

## 🧭 Overview

This repository offers two main resources to help you use Obsidian for scientific research:

**1. Step-by-step instructions** for learning the core features of Obsidian while building your own research-supporting Vault. Small, real-world scenarios illustrate how the Vault’s features can be applied in practice.

**2. A completed example Vault** that you can download and explore directly in Obsidian.

If you're new to Obsidian, I recommend starting with the guided instructions — they not only teach the basics but also help you understand the Vault's structure.
If you're already familiar with Obsidian, you can dive into the finished Vault and use the instructions as a reference to explore its features.
