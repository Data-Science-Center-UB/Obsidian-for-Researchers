# How to use your Daily Note
*(Duration approx. 15min)*

## Scenario-Based Learning: Navigating Your Daily Note Experience

**Aim:** *Provide you with practical experience in using the Daily Note effectively.*

*If none of these scenarios resonate with you, take a moment to reflect on your daily workflows: What are typical scenarios in your daily work? How can the daily note help you?*

## First Scenario: Shortly before your meeting

*Your workday begins. You have a few moments before your first meeting to check your emails.*

**1. Open the daily note.**

**2. Plan reading an article**
You receive an email with a promising reference to a article that's perfectly suited to your field. You don't have time to read the article now as you have a meeting soon, but you want to get an overview of the text this afternoon. Go to your Daily Note and write under **New**: 

```markdown
- [ ] Check literature  [Feline gravity manipulation](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.22919)
```       

*An auto-suggest menu should automatically appear in the line, where you can select **due date** and then **type or select today's date**. This only happens if the date is written after the text.*
   
**Tip:** *The auto-suggest menu pops up only if the cursor is in a line that is recognized as a task, that is, the line contains a checkbox. If due date is not suggested in the auto-suggest menu, type due and it will appear.*

**Tip:** *When you insert a link to a homepage from your browser's command line into a note in Obsidian, the application automatically generates Markdown syntax for the link. This syntax follows the format `[Title of Homepage](URL).` You can change the title to better reflect the content of the link.*

**3. Overdue Tasks**

*Before the meeting you check your overdue task list. You see a task that you took on after your last meeting that you forgot to do. You complete the task quickly so that you can tell the others straight away that you've done it.*

1. To simulate this situation, **type the following under "Daily Log":**

```markdown
- [ ] Write important email to an important person
```     

2. **Select today's date and correct it manually by entering the previous day.**

*Now it appears under "Overdue Tasks".*<br>
*Check the box and it appears under "Done Today"*

**4. Optional: Recurring tasks**
*Works only for the template with the recurring tasks.*

*Your colleague will be on a business trip for the next few weeks and asks if you can water his office plants once a week. You like plants and agree. Since you're always in the office on Wednesdays, write under "New:"* 

```markdown
- [ ] Water Semi's plants
```         

*Again an auto-suggest menu should appear. If recurring is not provided in the auto-suggest menu, type *recurring* and it will appear: Choose **recurring every week on Wednesday** and **select a start date**.*

**5. Optional: Scheduled task:**
*Works only for the template with the scheduled tasks.*

*The deadline for contributions to a conference is at the end of next month. You will only have time to write the abstract for your paper after your vacation. Write under “New”:*

```markdown
- [ ] contribution conference abstract, Deadline "end of next month" 
```   

**Select "Schedule date" and select the date "after your vacation" (for demonstration purpose, select a date in the future).**

*The task now appears in the section "Upcoming Tasks".*

## 2. Second Scenario: Your meeting begins
**Tip:** *Often, I only make short bullet point notes during the meeting and take 3 minutes after the meeting to distribute the to-dos throughout my week/month/year.*

2.1 You take on the task of writing an important email to a cooperation partner for your project. However, the email shouldn't be sent until next Monday. Write under **New**: 
```markdown
- [ ] Write email to cooperation partner
```         
Select **due date** and **next Monday** in the auto-suggest menu.

The task now appears in the section "Upcoming Tasks"

2.3 While your colleagues are discussing a topic, you come up with an idea on how to write the introduction for the publication you're currently working on. Note under **Daily Log** your idea and link it to a potential idea collection of the publication: 

```markdown
- Introduction: sunflowers, interview, newspaper [[Publication Idea Collection]]
```         

**Core Obsidian Function: Linking Notes**
With double square brackets you can either create a new note `[[Title of new note]]`
or link an existing note `[[Title of existing note]]`.
The new note is created by clicking on the link. The colour of the link will change then from light purple to darker purple.
**Create the note "Publication Idea Collection" by clicking on the link.**
