# General Information

**Title:** Obsidian for Researchers: Customizing Your Digital Research Assistant
**Type:** Lecture and hands-on part
**Total Workload for participants:** 4h
**Number of max. participants:** 20
**Requirements for the room:** Projector, sockets, wifi, tables, chairs
**Technical Requirements for participants:** Should bring their own laptop with access to WLAN, installed Obsidian software
#### Time Frame
The training is designed for one day, 4 hours per day (with breaks): 1h 30min + 15min break + 2h 15min (Individual break during the hands-on part)
#### Target Audience and Prior Knowledge
This training is designed for researchers interested in evaluating and enhancing their personal knowledge management systems. It is particularly suited for those who wish to explore Obsidian as a note-taking application. No prior experience with Obsidian is required. However, it is recommended that participants consider beforehand whether they are interested in trying Obsidian for note-taking. Conducting preliminary research on the software is advised to ensure it aligns with their needs and expectations.
#### Workshop Goal
The goal of the workshop is to introduce researchers to the effective use of Obsidian for personal knowledge management. Participants will learn how to customize and utilize Obsidian as a digital research assistant to enhance their research workflows. By the end of the workshop, attendees should be able to set up and navigate Obsidian, understand its core functionalities, and apply it to their own research processes. The workshop aims to provide hands-on experience and practical knowledge, enabling researchers to make informed decisions about integrating Obsidian into their personal knowledge management systems.
#### Workshop Content
**Part 1: Introduction to Personal Knowledge Management**
- Explore effective note-taking systems and self-organization techniques, with a focus on how Obsidian can enhance your research workflow.
- Hands-On Exercise: Assess your current organization methods and discover how Obsidian can streamline and improve your knowledge management process.

**Part 2: Getting Started with Obsidian**
- Learn the core functionalities of Obsidian, including creating and managing notes using Markdown syntax.
- Dive into advanced features such as note linking, graph view, tags, and metadata for seamless organization.
- Customize your Obsidian workspace with plugins and interface adjustments to build a personalized, connected knowledge network.

Participants will take an individual break during this hands-on session. <br><br>Participants can access the GitHub repository via a link on the slide. For this purpose, the link has been shortened so they don't have to type the long URL. <br><br>Participants should follow the manual, and the trainer will be available for questions and troubleshooting.                                                                                                       | Presentation,<br>interactive | Slides,<br>GitHub repository | Laptop,<br>projector,<br>participants' laptops with Obsidian software |
