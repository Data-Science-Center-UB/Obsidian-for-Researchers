**Learning Objectives in this Exercise:**
- Learn the theory behind my approach to the Zettelkasten method.

## The Zettelkasten method by Niklas Luhmann

*I follow the Zettelkasten method (slip box method) of Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998), a German sociologist, which is surprisingly simple in its basic principles. There are many YouTube videos, blog articles etc. that complicate the method. 

*In Bielefeld (Germany) there is the Luhmann Archive, where his Zettelkasten has been digitized for several years. I am guided by the archivists' findings on Luhmann's Zettelkasten method. See: [Niklas Luhmann-Archiv](https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/)*

***What is a Zettelkasten?***
*A collection of slip of papers (Luhmann) or digital notes (Obsidian).* 
*A tool for thinking and an outsourced memory, but not an archive.*

***What is on a single "Zettel"?***
*An idea, a quote with your comment, a reference, an interesting question, an observation, an insight etc.*

***How are the "Zettel" connected?***
*Luhmann used an index system with numbers and figures that is no longer relevant for us, as we can make the connections digitally. For us it's important that each note has one or two connections to an existing note in the Zettelkasten.*

***How are the "Zettel" organized?***
*There is no predefined main topics into which the "Zettel" are sorted. Rather, the structure arises organically from the connection of the "Zettel". Luhmann did not have a table of contents, but a subject index with very general headings. There were one or two references to "Zettel" for each keyword. You could then use this entry point to find all the other notes on the topic, as they were linked to each other.*

***How do you use the Zettelkasten?***
*There are two main phases in the use of the card box, which are iterative:*
1. *input phase: In this phase, you feed the "Zettelkasten" with "Zettel".
2. *output phase: In this phase, you think together with the "Zettelkasten". 

## My Zettelkasten in Obsidian

*Disclaimer: Please feel free to develop your own way with your "Zettelkasten". The following makes sense to me, but might not be right for your projects.*

*I decided to use **Obsidian's bi-directional link function instead of the tags** to connect the notes. If a new main topic arises during linking, I can create a new note for the topic directly and have all the notes in one place. I can then even start writing a text on the topic in the note.*

***IMHO: Sorting by topic using tags is superfluous**
I don't use tags to assign a note to a main topic. I have had bad experiences with this type of tagging: At some point I had a list of 60 tags that I couldn't remember and I had to think long and hard each time about which overall topic the note belonged to. To find a topic in my notes or in my literature, I can also use the search function in Obsidian and the advanced search function in Zotero. This blog article really helped me reflect on how I use tags: [A Complete Guide to Tagging for Personal Knowledge Management](https://fortelabs.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-tagging-for-personal-knowledge-management/)*

***Nevertheless, I use tags in a specific way:***

**Tags in Zotero:**
*In Zotero, I only use a few colored tags to record the way I read a text: `#read, #selective_read, #in_progress, #skimmed.` The color is then displayed in the overview of my references. This gives me a quick overview of what I have already read and what I have not.*

**Tags in Obsidian:**
*In Obsidian, I use tags to assign notes to a project. This is a flexible tag system. When I have a new project, I can simply add a new tag to existing notes and associate them with the project. This is a more output-oriented way of using tags.*

*Example: I am doing a cumulative doctorate and am currently working on the first paper. For my three papers I have the tags: `#p1_literature_review, #p2_pre_study, #p3_main_study.` After a while, the structure of the first paper slowly emerges and I add `#p1_1_introduction, #p1_2_key_findings`*

***That's the theory, let's dive into the practice. In the next instructions there are examples of applications that show how the whole thing can be used.***
