**Learning Objectives in this Exercise:**
- Transfer knowledge from Zotero to Obsidian.
- Process this knowledge using the **Zettelkasten method** in your Obsidian vault.

## Step 1: Prepare the Article in Zotero

Before creating your third *Zettel*, open **Zotero**.

1. **Add the article** from Exercise 03a as a PDF to your Zotero library.  
   **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2012.6248092](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2012.6248092)

2. **Highlight the following paragraph:**

   > *"From this candidate list, images were dropped if any of the following conditions applied, as judged by the annotators: (i) the image was grayscale, (ii) another image portraying the same animal existed (which happens frequently in Flickr), (iii) the illumination was poor, (iv) the pet was not centered in the image, or (v) the pet was wearing clothes."*

3. **Add this comment to the highlighted paragraph:**

   > *Pets in Clothes:* The research team found that one of the common issues with the images collected for their dataset was pets wearing clothes. The article mentions that images of pets dressed up were often discarded, which implies that while some owners may enjoy dressing their pets, it complicates the task of accurately identifying their breed.

4. **Add a the tag `#p1_literature_review` to the comment.**

5. **Clean up the reference item:**
   - Remove all existing tags from the reference item.
   - Add the tag: `#skimmed`

## Step 2: Create a Source Note in Obsidian

1. **Open Obsidian.**
2. **Press** `Ctrl + P`, then select:  
   ➔ *Zotero Integration: Add Source Note*
3. The *Quick Format Citation* window will open (via Zotero).
4. **Search for and select the reference:** *Parkhi et al., 2012*
5. **Press** `Enter`.

## Step 3: Turn the Knowledge into a "Zettel"

*Each paragraph and its comment can now become an individual "Zettel". If you have many paragraphs, start with the most important ones. You can return later to process the rest.*

1. **Under the section containing the abstract, write the following link:**
	`[[error_pets_wearing_clothes]]`

**Click the link and create a new note** → **Press** ALT + E → **Select** "Zettel_Template"

2. **Click the link** to create a new note.

3. **Press** `Alt + E`, then **select** *Zettel_Template* to structure your note.

4. **Organize the content in the "Zettel"** as shown below.  
	*(You don’t need to fill in the reference section — backlinks will cover this.)*

## Step 4: Create a Subject Index

Since you now have three "Zettel" related to the topic of cats — and you plan to continue working on this subject — this is a great moment to create a dedicated tag page.

1. **In your Obsidian vault**, navigate to your Zettelkasten folder (e.g., `ZEKA/ZETTEL`).

2. **Create a new note titled:** `[[cats]]`

3. **Click the link** to generate the new page.

4. **Inside the new "cats" page**, add a link to one of your cat-related Zettels.  
	For example: `[[cats_in_space]]`

*This link will serve as an **entry point** to all your notes about cats, helping you build a connected knowledge base around this theme.*
