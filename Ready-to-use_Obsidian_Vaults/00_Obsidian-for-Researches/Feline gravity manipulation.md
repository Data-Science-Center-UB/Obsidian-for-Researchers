​The article "Feline Gravity Manipulation" by Viktor T. Toth, published on arXiv in March 2025, presents a humorous yet thought-provoking exploration of the idea that domestic cats (Felis catus) possess the unique ability to manipulate their passive gravitational mass. This conjecture is inspired by the feline's seemingly effortless defiance of gravity, such as their ability to land on their feet from high falls or perch in precarious positions.​

Toth delves into this whimsical hypothesis by examining it through the lenses of general relativity and quantum physics. He suggests that studying feline behavior in gravitational fields could potentially offer insights into complex physical phenomena like neutrino mass mixing and the unification of gravity with quantum field theory.​

While the paper is satirical in nature, it cleverly uses scientific language and concepts to entertain and engage readers, highlighting the mysterious and agile nature of cats in a lighthearted manner.
